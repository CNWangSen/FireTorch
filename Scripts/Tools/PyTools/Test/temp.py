tx="A grotesque hybrid from Shanhai Jing: ​​ram's body​​ fused with a ​​human face​​, its ​​piercing eyes​​ glaring from beneath armpits. Jagged ​​tiger-like fangs​​ protrude from a gaping maw, while ​​humanoid claws​​ clutch ritual bronze vessels adorned with swirling ​​thunder patterns​​. The creature crouches amidst dark, mist-shrouded mountains, embodying primal greed as crimson glyphs of ancient warnings faintly glow on weathered stone."
